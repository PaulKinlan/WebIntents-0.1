    <h1>Web Intents</h1>
    <p><em>Paul Kinlan - November 2010</em></p>

      <a href="https://github.com/PaulKinlan/WebIntents"> https://github.com/PaulKinlan/WebIntents</a>
    </p>
    <p>A framework for Web-based Inter-app communication and service
       discovery.</p>
    
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>A little bit of magic.</p>
    <p>
      Actually it is pretty simple, there is a shared domain (in this case
      http://webintents.appspot.com/) that hosts the messaging channel.
      Both service and client host an IFRAME pointing to the framework and uses 
      SharedWorkers to communicate between apps.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Sample Applications</h2>
    <p>
      A collection of sample applications to show you how what can be done with
      the Web Intents Framework.
    </p>
    
    <h3>URL Shortener</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="/demo/urlshortener.html" target="_blank">Service</a> - The app
      registers its intention to provide services for the #shorten command.  It 
      receives messages from external applications and processes them returning
      them to the calling application.
    </p> 
    <p><a href="/demo/simpleurlapp.html" target="_blank">Client</a> - This app
      is a "Status posting" application, one of the functions it provides is
      the ability to shorten URL's using 3rd party services, the user has the
      option to chose one of many shortening services.  Not both app and service
      don't know about each other.  Also, check out that it integrates with 
      "Streamie.org" 
      (<a href="http://paulkinlan.streamie.org/index.html">well a branch of</a>)
    </p>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      On the web today applications have two methods that they can use to
      talk to each other. They can use:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Server to Server communication</li>
      <li>and Cross document messaging.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The web has some awesome services built using these technologies, however
      they have a severe limitation: both apps need to know about each other.
      Contracts have to be arranged and services written.
    </p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
      This.
    </p>
    <p>
      A framework that allows developers to register their API's for simple 
      discovery and ease of interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      A system that allows developers to discover APIs and quickly integrate
      with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ingenious solution that aides cross-document messaging in a safe and 
      secure manner
    </p>
    <p>
      Most Importantly, a system that allows <em>the user</em> to control the
      services that their applications interact with.

    <h2>A bit more info</h2>
    <p>It's like Androids Intents, but for the Web.</p>
    <h2>The 20 second guide for Developers</h2>
    <h3>For Service Builders</h3>
    <p>You have a service that you want other developers to use.</p>
    <p>Add a script tag: <code>
      &lt;script src="http://webintents.appspot.com/lib/client.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    </code>
    </p>
    <p>Initialize your service:
      
      <pre><code>window.channel.initialize(
  function() {
    // Some basic meta-data about your service.
    var data = {
      "name" : "Easy Shorten - URL Shortener"
    };
    
    // Register that we are providing an intent.
    window.channel.registerIntent(
      "shorten", 
      data, 
      handleMessage // Your function
    );
  });</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>Add your handler for incoming messages: 
      <pre><code>var handleMessage = function(message, response) {
  // process in-coming messages.
  ...
  // If you want to return some data, you can
  if(response) {
    response({
      "data" : somedata
    });
  }
}</code></pre></p>
    <h3>For Service Integrators</h3>
    <p>You have a site that uses other developers services.</p>
    <p>Add a script tag: <code>
      &lt;script src="http://webintents.appspot.com/lib/client.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    </code></p>
    <p>
      Initialize the communication channel:
      <pre><code>window.channel.initialize();</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Query the system for the type of service you want to use:
      <pre><code>window.channel.discover("shorten", {}, function(data) {
  // handle the list of intents that can handle this.
  var intents = data.intents;
  for(var intent in intents) {
    // Show the user a list of services they can use.
  }
}); </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Send the application some data:
      <pre><code>window.channel.send(
  method,
  {
    "data" : anObject
  }, 
  function(data) {
    // This is the response from the app that we sent a message too.
    ...
    // Not all apps will return data.
  });</code></pre>
    </p>
