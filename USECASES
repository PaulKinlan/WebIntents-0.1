Send File + Share File

** Usecase **

A user uses a web based email provider.

A user is manipulating a file in an online image editing application.

Currently, the user has to download the file into a temporary directory and then
upload it to the email client.

This is a less than optimal experience, even with drag and drop support.

registerProtocolHandler Javascript interface is unable to handle this usecase as it can only initiate a "create email" via the "mailto://" handler, and possibly
have some extra meta data specified.  All this data is specific to the application and the addressee, rather allowing the user to have control.

** Process **

- The Web-based email client (SERVICE) registers its intention to be able to receive requests "Send a file" with the Intents framework (BROKER)
-- MAY provide a list of supported mime type
-- MUST provide a protocol SEND
-- MUST register a method that is involked when called

- The Image application (CLIENT) includes the BROKER framework and provides a custom interface for the ability to SEND images.

- The user wishes to SHARE an image and invokes the UI in the CLIENT that will initiate the share

- The CLIENT asks the BROKER for a list of providers that can handle the SHARE command, for the supported mime type.
-- The BROKER returns a list of known services including SERVICE
-- The CLIENT will show a list of services

- The USER selects the service they want to use for the command

- The CLIENT sends a message to the USER selected SERVICE
-- The message is formatted using the SEND protocol

** The SEND protocol **

The protocol will be named 'http://web-send.org/send/'

It is imperative that consistent protocols are used to send data between applications.  To send a file between applications it must be part of a standardised message format.

Key properties:
- filename (Content-Disposition?)
- mime-type
- length
- data (base64 encoded? Blob?)


- The Service 

** User Interface **



Usecase 2.

The user of an email provider wants to send an image that is in a known image gallery on the web.  Rather than navigate to the applicaiton and send the file to the email client, the user should be able to ask for a list of applications that support file discovery.  Then once selected, allow the user to pick the file.

Gmail will issue a request to be able to get a list of files from another application
